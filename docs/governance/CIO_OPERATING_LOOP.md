# CIO Operating Loop

## Loop
Issue -> Design Note -> PR -> Evidence -> Decision Log

## Required PR Sections
- Hypothesis
- Expected Value
- KPI (baseline -> target)
- Risk Class
- Rollback Plan
- Owner
- Evidence Link
- Decision Log Link

## Labels
- innovation-proposal
- experiment
- scale-candidate
- rejected-with-rationale
- human-approval-required

## Promotion Rule
Promotion to scale-candidate requires an Evidence link (or a justified exception in the ADR).

## Delegated Approval (Single-human mode)
If sensitive paths change, require label human-approval-required and an ai-ops team review request; habitat-warden must pass.
